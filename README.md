7. What suggestions would you give to the social media team if they want to expand their presence (e.g. if our CSGO youtube channel is doing well should we expand to TikTok)?
Answer:If the CS:GO YouTube channel is performing well, it indicates a positive response from the audience on that platform. Expanding to TikTok could be a viable option to reach a wider audience and explore a different content format. However, before expanding to TikTok or any new platform, it is recommended to conduct research and analysis to understand the target audience on that platform, the type of content that resonates with them, and the potential benefits and challenges of expanding to that specific platform. This will help make informed decisions and ensure effective utilization of resources.
